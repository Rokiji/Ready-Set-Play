Problem Statement: (What to solve)
Gaming and music are two of the most popular forms of entertainment. Many gaming platforms focus solely on gameplay, requiring players to use separate applications or websites for music. This often leads to a fragmented experience, where users must switch between tabs or external music players, disrupting immersion and convenience. While some platforms offer in-game music, they lack personalization, limiting users to pre-set soundtracks instead of allowing them to play their own preferred songs.

This project aims to solve this issue by creating an integrated web-based platform that provides a seamless gaming and music experience. Ready, Set, Play allows users to enjoy a variety of mini games while listening to their favorite music, all within a single, user-friendly interface. By eliminating the need for external music players and offering full control over audio playback without interrupting gameplay, this platform enhances user convenience, engagement, and entertainment.
